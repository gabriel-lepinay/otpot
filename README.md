> You need to have docker installed on your server/machine. You can follow the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to do it.

**[Linux users]**\

If it's not the case, you can change it temporarily for the current terminal session you're using by typing: `umask 0022`.\
It will ensure that the files are cloned with the right permission.\
\
After that you can download the repository using `git clone https://github.com/gabriel-lepinay/otpot.git`

## How to use it 

#### Attack map config
To get the API key for threat level calculation please register an account here abuseipdb.com then put the key in [/attack_map/key.txt](./attack_map/key.txt)

---

#### Data generator config
If you need more customization for the data generator you can change the **``config.json``**  file in the **[data_generator](./data_generator)** folder, the structure of the json should look like this.

```
{
  "web": {
    "port": 80
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "address": "mqqt.local",
    "port": 1883,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password"
  },
  "coap": {
    "address": "coap.local",
    "port": 5683
  },
  "modbus": {
    "address": "modbus.local",
    "port": 502
  }
}

```

Where the web sets the variables for the gui and the mqtt, coap and modbus set the connection values for the servers.

---

#### Mqtt config

For mqtt make sure to set an password in the [/mqtt/config/pwfile](./mqtt/config/)
the formate of the **pwfile** should be user:password, make sure you set this username and password in the data_generator config file as stated above.
